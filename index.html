    <h3>Origin of Banana Bread</h3>

    <p>Banana bread first became a standard feature of American cookbooks with the popularization of baking soda and baking powder in the 1930s,
        <br>
        appeared in Pillsbury's 1933 Balanced Recipes cookbook, and later gained more acceptance with the release of the original Chiquita Banana's Recipe Book in 1950.
        <br>
        The origin of the first banana bread recipe is unknown, though some speculate it was originated in the 18th century by housewives experimenting with pearlash.
        <br>
        The home baking revival of the 1960s and the simplicity of its recipe led to an explosion in banana bread's popularity.</p>

        <p>Hot chocolate, also known as hot cocoa or drinking chocolate, is heated chocolate milk. Hot chocolate made with melted chocolate is sometimes called drinking chocolate, characterized by less sweetness and a thicker consistency.The first chocolate drink is believed to have been created by the Maya around 2,500–3,000 years ago,
        <br> 
        and a cocoa drink was an essential part of Aztec culture by 1400 AD, by which they referred to as xocōlātl.The drink became popular in Europe after being introduced from Mexico in the New World and has undergone multiple changes since then.
        Until the 19th century, hot chocolate was used medicinally to treat ailments such as liver and stomach diseases. </p>
